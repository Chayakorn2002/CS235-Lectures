2) My opinion about Vim

	I think vim is really an convenient tool for me to focus with my text-based work because I like the concept of no need to move our hand around, we can place our hand in the exact position and deal with many case of editing the text with various useful command but I'm kinda get into the problem with one thing that is my "esc" is kinda far away from my hand and in vim we mainly use "esc" so it's kinda troublesome for me but I will find a way and improve my current self.
